PART 1
Q1. What insights can you draw?
Ans. The analysis shows promising result and exposes few important inferences.
-	GAD-7 scores are uniform among patients with almost same range.
-	There is a significant increase in the no. of assessments with time. This is a good sign as it shows people are more open to assessments now as they were before.
-	Majority of people are in low to minimal status yet there is still significant no. of people who need immediate care.
-	Almost 5000 patients have no impact of therapy. These patients need considerate consultation and therapies.
-	The condition of almost 2500 patients worsened. These patients need extensive therapies and frequent help.
-	Almost 4500 patients are redundant for this analysis as their both initial and latest assessment score is 0. There is a possibility that these patients are not still open to revealing their anxiety issues. They need considerate consultation from therapists.


Q2. What assumptions have you made about the data?
Ans. There are few assumptions made prior to analysis as mentioned below.
-	The data is reliable and true depiction of patientâ€™s behavior.
-	The parameters of GAD-7 score are uncorrelated or else they can create a bias in our analysis.
-	All the assessments of a patient are taken during the same daytime to emulate same mood and feelings.


Q3. What are 2-3 additional pieces of information that would be important to collect?
Ans. Some additional pieces of information which could have been important to collect are listed below:
-	The data is quite generic and needs more important parameters like age, gender, location, relationship status, etc. which could have helped us in detailed analysis like decision tree and clustering.
-	The date and time of the therapy sessions should also be recorded.
